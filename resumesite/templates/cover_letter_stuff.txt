I am licensed to teach Physics, Mathematis, and Computer Sience in the State of Indiana, and I am in my sixth year of teaching at Floyd Central. I have taught Analytical Algebra II, Honors Algebra II, and Geometry in the Math Department, and I have taught Computer Science I, II &#38; III along with Earth Space, Integrated Chemistry and Physics, and AP Physics in the Science Department. I took over the Computer Science Program from a retiring teacher when I switched to the Science Department in Fall 2022, and I modernized that program and tripled its class sizes. I have taught Introductory Computer Science (CSI) and AP Computer Science A (CSII) since Fall 2022, and in Fall 2023 I pioneered an advanced Software Development (CSIII) course for Floyd Central. I also sponsor and host the Floyd Central Robotics Club which compete at Vex V5 tournaments and in the past I sponsored a Bouldering Club. In 2018 I also assisted the Floyd Central Highlander Band as a Staff Member for the Drumline.

I worked in the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program supervised by Dr. Aqlan in the Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Louisville and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). I worked with Dr. Aqlan, graduate student Azam Radman, and Hardin County Schools teacher Melissa Goes on academic research for and development of an simulation game for manufacturing and supply chain decision making. The online simulation was written as a Streamlit app, and, among other tasks, I wrote code to generate and support the teacher dashboard and the team-based, multiplayer infrastructure for the game. Melissa and I presented our research and work on the simulation at the 2023 NSF RET Virtual Poster Session.
